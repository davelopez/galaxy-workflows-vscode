## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/davelopez/galaxy-workflows-vscode/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [`help wanted`](https://github.com/davelopez/galaxy-workflows-vscode/labels/help%20wanted) issues.

You can also try to fix a [`paper-cut`](https://github.com/davelopez/galaxy-workflows-vscode/labels/paper-cut) which are trivially fixable usability bugs or easy enhancements.
